# :wave: Hi there, I'm Andre

Data, Cloud, [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) & [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) Enthusiast, Community Addict and Cloud Solution Architect @ [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)

## :superhero_man: About Me

In my role as Cloud Solution Architect, I advise customers in topics all around Microsofts Data Platform. Since version 7.0 I am gathering experience with the SQL Server product family, where I had a focus on infrastructure topics, mission-critical systems and security. Today I concentrate on working with data in the cloud, like Modern Data Warehouse architectures, Artificial Intelligence and new scalable database systems like Azure Cosmos DB.
