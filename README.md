# :wave: Hi there, I'm Andre

Data- & Cloud Native, Community Addict and Solutions Architect at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com)

## :superhero_man: About Me

I help organizations turn data and AI into measurable business outcomes by designing open, cloud-native Lakehouse platforms and defining data strategies that scale with the business, not against it.

With 25+ years in enterprise IT and consulting, and more than 7 years specializing in the aviation industry, I have supported customers through complex transformations where reliability, cost efficiency, and regulatory constraints matter. My work spans modernizing large Teradata and Hadoop environments into Databricks Lakehouse architectures, enabling AI-ready data foundations, and delivering mission-critical analytics solutions for MRO, operations, and decision support. The focus is always on faster time to insight, reduced platform complexity, and sustainable architectures that support long-term growth.

Today, I work as a Solutions Architect at Databricks, helping customers design and adopt Azure Databricks and modern Lakehouse architectures. I work closely with business and technical stakeholders to align platform capabilities with concrete outcomes such as operational efficiency, improved forecasting, data-driven decision making, and accelerated innovation. My strength lies in translating business goals into pragmatic technical architectures and guiding organizations from strategy to execution.

Beyond customer engagements, I am an international speaker, community leader, former Microsoft MVP, and Friend of Redgate. I previously led the PASS Munich Data Platform community and organized events such as SQL Saturday and PowerShell Saturday. I enjoy sharing practical experience, building strong professional communities, and helping teams grow their data and analytics maturity.
